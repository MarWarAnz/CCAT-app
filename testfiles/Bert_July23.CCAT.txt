Pressure Relief Strategies completed 2
Has the pressure been released from the patient and if so how are they feeling?
Will they regain feeling in their limbs or not? Did these notes work or not?

Infusion Location documented (NOT venous/arterial) 2
Hopefully it works? Although I think I did the format for this one wrong but if it does work cool! Numbers like 1, 2 ,3 should work right? I don't know!
