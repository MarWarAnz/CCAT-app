Elliott, your mission, should you choose to accept, will be to:

	1) Implement threading with the splash screen, as I believe you said you've 
	already done
	
	2) Continue working on creating, storing and validating user accounts
	
	3) Try to figure out the window resizing problem

Nice touch with the icon btw, it looks awesome!

This message will now self-destruct... not actually... but it would be cool if it did.
