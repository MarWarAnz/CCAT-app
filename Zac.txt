Zac, your mission, should you choose to accept will be to build a layout for the admins
tab including a chart (visible for everyone) and tools for creating and deleting
administrator accounts (admins only) by Friday, January 8th.

After those are done, feel free to get started on one of the following tasks if you are 
feeling ambitious:

	1) Reading in files to populate the charts (might need to do this for the chart 
	   anyways)
	
	2) file browser to pick which to be read in (check if .ccat file)
	
	3) delete files from within the app
	
	4) read in all files from the last week (two weeks, etc) into the app at once(as a 
	   list view?) as well as give option to delete individual files from this list
