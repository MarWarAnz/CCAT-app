Zac, your next mission, should you choose to accept, will be to:

	1) Implement a chart that can scroll horizontally

	2) add options to admin tasks that will allow a user to open a single file (using 
	a file browser) or open all files in folder in the format we discussed in our
	meeting.

Great job with the admin layout so far, the nested tab pane was a nice touch.

This message will now self-destruct... Jk, that would be unsafe.
